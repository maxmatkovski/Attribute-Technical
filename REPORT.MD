- Bundle compute + storage for higher value
- User count is a leading indicator for expansion

---

### VISUALIZATION 4: Risk & Opportunity - Revenue Concentration

**Key Findings:**
- Top 20% of customers generate 55-60% of total revenue
- Top 10% generate 35-40% of revenue
- Average discount rate: 5.74%
- Enterprise customers receive highest discounts (6.1%)

**Business Impact:**
- High concentration creates vulnerability
- Need to diversify mid-tier customer base
- Discount policies may be too aggressive

---

### ONE-PARAGRAPH SUMMARY

The analysis of 1,500 B2B cloud customers reveals a business with strong fundamentals generating $349,643 in net revenue, but facing strategic challenges requiring immediate attention. Standard plan customers drive volume (39% of base, $152K revenue) while Enterprise customers drive value ($265 avg per customer), yet significant revenue concentration exists with the top 20% of accounts generating 55-60% of total revenue, creating substantial business risk. Usage pattern analysis shows compute hours as the primary revenue driver with 0.92 correlation, indicating that compute optimization should be the focus of product development and pricing strategy. Month-over-month volatility with 1,849 detected anomalies (942 cost spikes, 907 drops) suggests a usage-driven billing model that creates revenue unpredictability and potential churn signals. The most significant opportunity lies in converting 157 Free tier accounts to paid plans (potential $30K+ monthly recurring revenue), while the most critical risk is the aggressive discount policy averaging 5.74% with Enterprise customers receiving disproportionately high discounts that erode margins. Strategic priorities should focus on revenue diversification through mid-tier growth, proactive anomaly response to prevent churn (especially the 907 accounts with >50% cost drops), pricing optimization to protect margins, and development of compute-focused features that drive the strongest revenue correlation.

## PART 2: ANOMALY DETECTION

### Goal
Identify unexpected changes in cloud cost or usage to alert FinOps or Customer Success teams to potential issues, expansion opportunities, or churn risks.

### Detection Criteria
- **Cost Spikes:** >100% month-over-month increase
- **Cost Drops:** >50% month-over-month decrease

### SQL QUERY FOR ANOMALY DETECTION

```sql
-- Anomaly Detection: Month-over-Month Cost Spikes and Drops

WITH monthly_costs AS (
    SELECT 
        b.account_id,
        b.month,
        b.cost_usd,
        LAG(b.cost_usd) OVER (
            PARTITION BY b.account_id 
            ORDER BY b.month
        ) as prev_month_cost,
        ((b.cost_usd - LAG(b.cost_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY b.account_id ORDER BY b.month)) / 
         NULLIF(LAG(b.cost_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY b.account_id ORDER BY b.month), 0) * 100
        ) as pct_change
    FROM billing b
),
anomalies AS (
    SELECT 
        mc.*,
        CASE 
            WHEN mc.pct_change > 100 THEN 'SPIKE'
            WHEN mc.pct_change < -50 THEN 'DROP'
            ELSE 'NORMAL'
        END as anomaly_type
    FROM monthly_costs mc
    WHERE mc.prev_month_cost IS NOT NULL
      AND (mc.pct_change > 100 OR mc.pct_change < -50)
)
SELECT 
    a.account_id,
    acc.account_name,
    acc.plan_type,
    acc.industry,
    a.month,
    a.prev_month_cost,
    a.cost_usd as current_cost,
    ROUND(a.pct_change, 2) as pct_change,
    a.anomaly_type
FROM anomalies a
JOIN accounts acc ON a.account_id = acc.account_id
ORDER BY ABS(a.pct_change) DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### DETECTION RESULTS

**Total Anomalies: 1,849**
- **Spikes:** 942 (>100% increase)
- **Drops:** 907 (>50% decrease)

**By Plan Type:**
- Standard: 371 spikes, 364 drops
- Pro: 352 spikes, 335 drops
- Enterprise: 139 spikes, 125 drops
- Free: 80 spikes, 83 drops

### MOST SIGNIFICANT ANOMALY

**Account A0814 (Company_814)**
- **Plan:** Pro | **Industry:** SaaS | **Region:** EMEA
- **Month:** September 2024
- **Change:** $3.93 â†’ $20.40 (+419.08%)

**Root Cause:**
- Compute hours jumped from 100-150 avg to 260 hours
- Storage increased to 95 GB
- Network spiked to 80 GB
- Pattern: Cyclical spikes every 3-4 months (seasonal projects)

**Explanation:**
This 419% spike alerts teams to several scenarios. **Positive:** Customer may have launched new product/feature, experiencing seasonal growth, or deployed new workloads - all indicating successful expansion. **Negative:** Could be misconfiguration, security incident, billing error, or surprise bill risk leading to customer dissatisfaction. For FinOps, this impacts revenue forecasting and presents cost optimization opportunities through reserved capacity. For Customer Success, proactive outreach prevents surprise bills and creates upsell opportunities to Enterprise plans. The pattern shows this is the third spike in 12 months, suggesting cyclical SaaS usage requiring capacity planning discussions rather than a one-time anomaly.

**Recommended Action:**
1. Immediate: Verify spike was expected
2. Proactive: Offer reserved capacity or savings plans
3. Opportunity: Discuss Enterprise upgrade
4. Monitoring: Set alerts for future changes

- **Automated data loading** from CSV files
- **Alert report generation** for stakeholders
- **Multiple export formats** (CSV, JSON)
- **Command-line interface** for scheduling

### Python Implementation

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import json
from datetime import datetime

class AnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self, spike_threshold=100, drop_threshold=-50):
        self.spike_threshold = spike_threshold
        self.drop_threshold = drop_threshold
        self.anomalies = None
        
    def load_data(self, billing_df, accounts_df=None):
        self.billing = billing_df.copy()
        self.accounts = accounts_df.copy() if accounts_df is not None else None
        
    def detect_anomalies(self):
        # Sort by account and month
        billing_sorted = self.billing.sort_values(['account_id', 'month']).copy()
        
        # Calculate previous month cost
        billing_sorted['prev_month_cost'] = billing_sorted.groupby('account_id')['cost_usd'].shift(1)
        
        # Calculate changes
        billing_sorted['cost_change'] = billing_sorted['cost_usd'] - billing_sorted['prev_month_cost']
        billing_sorted['pct_change'] = ((billing_sorted['cost_usd'] - billing_sorted['prev_month_cost']) / 
                                         billing_sorted['prev_month_cost'] * 100).round(2)
        
        # Classify anomalies
        billing_sorted['anomaly_type'] = np.where(
            billing_sorted['pct_change'] > self.spike_threshold, 'SPIKE',
            np.where(billing_sorted['pct_change'] < self.drop_threshold, 'DROP', 'NORMAL')
        )
        
        # Filter for anomalies
        self.anomalies = billing_sorted[
            (billing_sorted['anomaly_type'] != 'NORMAL') & 
            (billing_sorted['prev_month_cost'].notna())
        ].copy()
        
        # Merge with accounts if available
        if self.accounts is not None:
            self.anomalies = self.anomalies.merge(
                self.accounts[['account_id', 'account_name', 'plan_type', 'industry', 'region']], 
                on='account_id', how='left'
            )
        
        self.anomalies = self.anomalies.sort_values('pct_change', key=abs, ascending=False)
        return self.anomalies
    
    def save_results(self, output_path, format='csv'):
        if format == 'csv':
            self.anomalies.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
        elif format == 'json':
            self.anomalies.to_json(output_path, orient='records', indent=2)

# Usage Example
detector = AnomalyDetector(spike_threshold=100, drop_threshold=-50)
detector.load_data(billing, accounts)
anomalies = detector.detect_anomalies()
detector.save_results('anomalies_detected.csv')
